== Scope
This document specifies the behavior of Web APIs that provide access to tiles of one or more geospatial data resource (collection) or from the whole dataset that the Web API offers. This standard defines how to discover which resources offered by the Web API can be retrieved as tiles, get metadata about the available tile sets (including metadata on what tile matrix set each tile set is partitioned and the limits of that tile set within a common potentially global tile matrix set) and how to request a tile.

The core conformance class is defined in a way that could be easily included in a web API that does not conform to the _OGC API - Common_ standard. A web API can combine some requirements classes of this OGC API standard with other OGC API standards (including _OGC API - Common_) to extend the scope of the Web API by adding functionality.
